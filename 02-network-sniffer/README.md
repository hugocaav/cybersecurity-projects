# üïµÔ∏è Project 02 - Network Sniffer with Scapy

## üéØ Objective
Capture live network packets and display basic metadata (IP source, destination, and protocol). Simulates functionality of tools like Wireshark.

---

## üõ† Tools Used
- Python 3
- Scapy library (`pip install scapy`)

---

## üöÄ How to Run
```bash
python3 sniffer.py
```

Optionally, run with elevated permissions:
```bash
sudo python3 sniffer.py
```

---

## üìö Use Case
Network sniffers are used by SOC analysts, penetration testers, and threat hunters to inspect live traffic for anomalies or malware behavior. They're vital for detecting suspicious activity on enterprise or personal networks.

> üß† This script teaches how to inspect packets at a basic level, see live traffic, and recognize real-time IP communication patterns.

## üì∏ Sample Output
```
[2025-06-17 11:53:04] TCP Packet: 172.19.30.104 --> 34.117.41.85
[2025-06-17 11:53:05] UDP Packet: 172.18.15.253 --> 8.8.8.8
```
