# 🔐 Project 03 - File Encryption and Decryption

# Objective
Encrypt and decrypt text files using symmetric encryption to demonstrate basic cryptography principles.

# Tools Used
- Python 3
- `cryptography` package (Fernet)

# Installation
```bash
pip3 install cryptography

📚 Use Case
Encrypting files is a fundamental security practice for protecting confidential information at rest or in transit. Organizations use symmetric encryption to safeguard logs, backups, credentials, and any data subject to privacy regulations (like HIPAA or GDPR).

🧠 This encryption tool demonstrates how to securely protect and recover sensitive data using strong encryption (AES + HMAC), and why key management is critical in secure systems.
