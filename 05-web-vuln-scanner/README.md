## 🚀 How to Run

### Install dependencies:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

## 📚 Use Case
Web vulnerability scanning is an essential step in securing web applications.
Admins and penetration testers use scanners to find misconfigurations before attackers do.

🧠 This scanner helps you learn how to test HTTP methods, security headers, and directory listing vulnerabilities.
